## RNN - Recurrent Neural Network
### /RNN_tutorial
Copying the [pytorch tutorial](https://tutorials.pytorch.kr/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial "go to pytorch tutorial").
### /RNN_and_LSTM
Implementation of LSTM based on [RNN_tutorial](#rnn_tutorial). Existing code was modularized and utilized. Compared the result of trained models RNN and LSTM.
